# Mental-Health-In-Schools


  While mental health has always been a factor in our education, it has only been recently that it has risen to the forefront of conversation about the impact it has on the education and school environments. In order to capture the impact mental health has on our educational systems today, we look at the mental health of several children in US high school level ages, through bullying rates in schools. We choose to look at bullying rate as it is a common and accurate predictor of general mental health in schools (Schneider, O'Donnell, Stueve, & Coulter), while being easier for an administration to measure as survey respondents may not always be forthcoming.

  We try to depict an accurate picture of the terrible condition of mental health in today's society and answer the following question: What can schools do to effectively decrease bullying rates, and subsequently improve general mental health?
